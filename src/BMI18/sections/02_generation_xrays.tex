\section{Generation of X-rays}

\subsection{Basic formulas}
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item \highlight{$\displaystyle c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0\epsilon_0}} = \lambda\nu$}
    \highlight{$\displaystyle E = h\nu = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$}
    \hfill rest mass: $mc^2=\unit[511]{eV}$
    \item Range of X-Rays: $\lambda = \unit[10]{pm} - \unit[10]{nm}$
    \item $E\ped{radiation} = n \cdot E\ped{photon}$ \quad with \quad $E\ped{photon} = h \cdot \nu = e U_a$
    \item $p\ped{photon} = mc = h/\lambda, \qquad \lambda\ped{min} = \frac{hc}{e U_a}$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Spectrum}
%
Photon flux vs E: Speaks by \textbf{Characteristic Radiation}.

Continuous spectrum by \textbf{Bremsstrahlung}: 1st el. deflection: Spectrum $0-E_{max}$, 2nd el. defl. Not to $E\ped{max}$ anymore.

If material changes: $E\ped{max} = const$, slope changes\\
If E changes: slope const., intersection with E-axis @ E

Low-Energy rad. absorbed anyway $\to$ Al filter $\to$ dose $\downarrow$

\subsection{Heat generation \& dissipation}
%
Efficiency: $\eta = \frac{\textrm{absorbed power}}{\textrm{incident power}} = 1\%$\\
$P_\textrm{heat} = U_a \cdot I_a \cdot (1-\eta)$ \textcolor{gray}{$= P - P_\textrm{X-ray}$}

\textbf{Dissipation} (Infrared): Diffusion ($\propto T^4$) and\\
Radiation ($\propto\Delta T$): $\lambda$ vs. $I$, $\lambda_\textrm{peak} = b/T$, $b = \unit[2.9\E{-3}]{mK}$
