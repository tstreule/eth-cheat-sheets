\section{Imaging with X-rays}

In $\log E$ vs. $\log\mu$ plot is Compton linear, but Photo decreasing.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Photo effect, char. radiation} (Desired):
    Photon gets completely absorbed by throwing an electron out of atom $\to$ damage.
    \textbf{Probability} $\propto \rho\cdot Z^3/E^3$,
    \textcolor{gray}{$\rho$: tissue density}\\
    \textit{Effective in} contrast agent, lead, bone
    \item \textbf{Compton Scattering} ($\to$ resolution loss):
    Photon only gets deflected.
    \textbf{Probability:} $\propto \rho/E$\\
    \textit{Effective in} water, air, soft tissue, bone\\
    Scattering angle $\phi$: \highlight{$\displaystyle \lambda_p - \lambda_{p'} = \frac{h}{m_c \cdot c} (1 - \cos \phi)$}
\end{itemize}
To only have photo effect $\to$ $E\downarrow$. Compromise with thick targets.

\textbf{Spatial resolution}: MTF is indicated in const vs \textbf{l}ine \textbf{p}airs/mm

\textbf{Temporal resolution}: periodic s.t. $\Delta t<1/\textrm{BW}\ped{heartbeat}$

\subsection{Attenuation coefficients \hfill\textnormal{efficient for small $E$}}
%
\textbf{Mass absorption}: $\mu' = \frac{A\ped{eff}N\ped{A}}{\textrm{atomic weight}} [\unitfrac{cm^2}{g}]$ \hfill area to collide with\\
\textbf{Linear attenuation}: $\mu = \mu' \cdot \rho [\unit{cm^{-1}}]$

\textbf{Beer-Lambert's law}: $I = \int \limits_0^{E\ped{max}} I_0(E) \eu^{-\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \mu(E,x)\diff x}\diff E$\\
$\mu$ homog.: \highlight{$\displaystyle I = I_0 \eu^{-\mu x}$} \hfill \textbf{Contrast} $\propto (\mu_1 - \mu_0)d = \ln(I_0/I)$

\subsection{Detector Technology}
%
Analog photographic film: $Ag^+ + Br^- \underbrace{\longrightarrow}_{photon} AgBr$\\
Use fluorescent screen (spacial res.$\uparrow$) $\longrightarrow$ 5x efficiency

\textbf{Anti-scatter grid}:
No grid: $c\ped{scatter} = \frac{(I+I_S) - (I_B + I_S)}{I_B + I_S} = c \cdot \frac{1}{1 + I_S/I_B}$ where $c = \frac{I - I_B}{I_B}$ is contrast with grid

\textbf{Digital Detector}: photofilm, excited el's $\to$ laser $\to$ PMT

\textbf{DSA}: Contrast Agent: Iodine: increases x-ray absorption.
